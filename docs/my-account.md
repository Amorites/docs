> \*Viewing, importing and installing is available for all users for public scopes.

### Transfer scopes

Here are the steps to transfer scopes that were created on personal account to an organizations account (or between different owners or scopes).

Make sure you have both scopes defined on bit.dev and that you have writing permissions to the new scope, and at least viewing permissions to the old scope.

```shell
# Create an empty directory and initialize it with a bit scope
$ mkdir <scope-dir> # create an empty directory
$ cd <scope-dir>
$ bit init
successfully initialized a bit workspace.

# Import all components from the old scope to the local scope
$ bit import "<old-owner>.<old-scope-name>/*"
successfully imported x components

# Export all components to the new scope rewiring all their dependencies to the new scope
$ bit export <new-owner>.<new-scope> --set-current-scope --rewire --include-dependencies --all
# bit requests approval
exported x components to scope <new-owner>.<new-scope>
```
