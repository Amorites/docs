# Why Bit?

- Component driven development takes over everything - e.g. React, Angular, Vue.
- Current ecosystem and tooling were not built for component-driven architectures.
- Bit was built for it.
- Bit makes the development, publishing and management of independent components very easy.

## Rapid app development

Building with components accelerates dev.

## Cross team collaboration

- Every team can own components and consume components from others.
- Changes propagate through CI/CD.

## Consistency

- Using the same components all over means consistency.
- Organizations are rebuilding the same components, it doesn't happen with Bit.

## Team and developer Autonomy

- Preserve autonomy with Bit import, lanes and quick local forking.
- Component has very little code. Easy to developers to understand and change them.

## Write component (code) once. Use anywhere. Really.

## Maintainable and Modular Architecture

## Quick and gradual refactoring

## Collaboration with non-developers

## Developer experience
