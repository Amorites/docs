Bit enables teams to work in a Polyrepo architecture but still get all the benefits of using a Monorepo and even more.

- Example org on Github: https://github.com/bit-demos
- Example org on Bit.dev: https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react

Acting repositories:

- [Base UI](https://github.com/bit-demos/base-ui)
- [ecommerce](https://github.com/bit-demos/ecommerce)
- [Perfume store](https://github.com/bit-demos/perfume-store)
- [Sports store](https://github.com/bit-demos/sports-store)
- [Shoe store](https://github.com/bit-demos/shoe-store)
- [Electronics store](https://github.com/bit-demos/shoe-store)

Directory structure for a each repo:

This is the graph of [Scopes](/scope/overview) helping understand how teams owning different responsibilities depend and collaborate with each other.

### Simple, decoupled codebases

Each team is maintaining a simple, decoupled codebase which includes the team's source code alone. Each codebase is a Bit [Workspace](/workspace/overview) which allows access to permitted [Scopes](/scope/overview) for either API usage or for making and proposing changes.

An example for a single decoupled codebase is: https://github.com/bit-demos/ecommerce.
This codebase is owned by the ecommerce team which might maintain different kind of APIs in the form of [UI components](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/ecommerce/ui/store-hero), <!--TODO [micro-services](/),  -->[applications](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/shoe-store/apps/shoe-store), [modules](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/ecommerce/entity/product) and even Markdown [content](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/ecommerce/content/about), or anything else.

Having a small codebase highly improves dev experience, dev performance and makes it easy for devs to onboard.

### API and source code accessibility

Components can be installed for consumption in the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory.

```bash
bit install
```

Component source code can also be [imported](/scope/importing-components) into the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) for collaboration and change proposal on Components owned by other teams, live in other repos.

```bash
bit import
```

### Diverge to more repos and scale over time

As a single codebase gets bigger, it be easily distributed and delegated to more teams taking responsibility over specific features and components.

### Easy developer on-boarding

Smaller codebases, means a faster ramp up and on-boarding to new developers. They have less code to get to know. Easy way to find the code they need and more confidence making changes.

### Code sharing and reuse

Code sharing and reuse is native across all repositories using Bit. Every component is made accessible through the [Scope](/scope/overview) for either API usage through an installation or by [Importing](scope/importing-components) the [Component](/components/overview) into your [Workspace](/workspace/overview).

Components are versioned independently with a [Semantic Version](https://semver.org) to help developer communicate per [Component](/components/overview) API changes.

```bash
bit tag --all
```

Components can annotated as Internal/Private <!--TODO [Internal/Private](/) --> using the internal namespace in the [Component ID](/components/component-id). Internal components won't be discoverable for others.

### Update automation

### Visibility and Discoverability

Developers gets visibility and discoverability to every Component in either the Workspace they are working on or [Components](/components/overview) from other [Scope](/scope/overview) regardless to the repo it is hosted on.

Using the [Bit Cloud](https://bit.dev) components can be found across repositories and Scopes with smart filters and semantic search.

### Testing affection of component changes

```bash
bit status
```

```bash
bit test --change
```

```bash
bit tag --all
```

### Cross team collaboration

### Atomic changes

Atomic changes across repositories can be done with [Lanes](/components/lanes). A Lane is like branch for tracking cross component and dependency changes. Lanes can be used across Bit Workspaces helping to drive large atomic changes across an organization even when distributed throughout

```bash
bit lane my-feature --create
```

After changes are tested and approved, they can be merged at once across all repositories in a single merge.

```bash
bit merge
```

:::note
Bit Cloud can be used to simulate and measure the effect of the changes on all Components using each of the used Components with Ripple CI<!--TODO [Ripple CI](https://bit.dev/ripple-ci) -->.
:::

### Consistent and standard tooling

Component development and tooling can be standardized with [Envs](/envs/overview).

<!--TODO ### Gradual refactoring

### Large scale refactoring

### Feedback loop

Feedback loops get shorter.

### Team autonomy

Team autonomy is preserved

### Dev experience -->
