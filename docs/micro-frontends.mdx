# Building a Micro Frontend architecture with Bit

What is a Micro Frontend? I think this is an open question that many are trying to answer these days.   
In my humble option, Micro Frontends is simply numerous autonomous teams collaborating on one or more web applications. 

## Bit

Bit is a component-based approach to modern application development. Bit makes the development and composition of modern 
applications from independent components, owned by infinite autonomous product teams, collaborating together on dozes of 
application simple, repeatable and fun.

## Simple, decoupled codebases
In a micro-service architecture, teams get little and focused codebases which highly ease on-boarding of new developers
and developer productivity.
With Bit, each team can its own dynamic component codebase... which allows them to maintain and own only the components they
are responsible for.

- Dynamic workspaces, for a team, or individual.
- Access and change any component from your workspace.
- Reuse any component/API built by any other team. 

## Autonomous teams
Every team with Bit owns a Scope.



## Composition approaches
Every team can independently release new versions to components, used across all in other applications. 

### Build-time


### Run-time
Solutions like Module Federation and Code Splitting help fetch modules during runtime. 


## Standardization

## Autonomy

## Performance

### Updates

### API Feedbacks

### CI/CD

## Data fetching



## Styling and Theming


## Testing
Each component is testing itself and its dependencies.

## Application performance


## Share components in any level of granularity.
Components can be shared in any level of granularity.

### Presentation components

### Applications.

## Server-side and micro-services
