A component ID is a unique string that serves as a global reference to a versioned [Component](/components/overview).

For example:

- When importing a component: `bit import <component-id>`
- When configuring an Aspect in the workspace configuration file: `{ "<component-id>": {"<key>": <value>} }`.

The component ID is composed of the component's scope and full name (which includes its namespaces).

```sh
<scope name>/<component full name>
```

For example, the component ID `my-org.my-scope/ui/inputs/button` is composed of:

- Scope name: `my-org.my-scope`

- Component full name: `ui/inputs/button`

A component ID may reference a specific component release version using the `@` sign:

`my-org.my-scope/ui/inputs/button@1.0.0`

## Scope name

A scope name describes the common purpose of its components, and by that, the goal of the team maintaining it.

- `base-ui` - all basic UI elements and components for building web-ui.
- `inventory` - a set of components relevant for inventory management in an e-commerce app.
- `authentication` - components for managing user authentication and tokens.

### Setting a scope name

Set the scope name for components by configuring the `workspace.jsonc`:

```jsonc {4} title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "ACME's Inventory Workspace",
    "defaultScope": "acme.inventory"
  }
}
```

:::tip Pre-fix scopes with the `.` separator

Scopes can be pre-fixed with an owner name (usually, an organization or sub-organization name).  
When hosting on Bit Cloud, the `<owner>.<scope-name` pattern is mandatory.

## Component full name

A component's full name serves as a unique identifier of a [Component](/components/overview) in the local workspace.
Most local operations require referencing a component using its full name rather than its ID.
A component's full name is composed of its namespaces (if there are any), and name.

```
<namespaces>/<component name>
```

### Setting a component full name

A component's full name is set when creating a new component using a template.
The below command will create a new component with the name `button` and the namespaces `ui` and `inputs`.

For example:

```bash
bit create react ui/inputs/button
```

When tracking a component manually, a component's full name is determined by the name of its Component Directory. Namespaces can be added using the `--namespace` option.

For example:

```bash
bit add my-scope/button --namespace ui/inputs
```

A component name can be manually set by using the `--id` option (this will override the name received by its Component Directory).

## Component name

A component name describes the concrete responsibility of a component.
It is determined by its Component Directory name, when added manually, or by the given name, when created using a template.

See the ['component full name'](#component-full-name) section, to learn more.

## Namespaces

Namespaces are used to organize components into categories in the Workspace and Remote Scope. They also help in preventing name conflicts in the same scope or workspace, by prefixing a component name with the relevant categories.

Namespaces can form a hierarchal order. For example, the following command creates a component, `button`, with the namespace `ui` and, nested inside it, the namespace `inputs`.

```sh
bit create react ui/inputs/button
```

This will show up in the Workspace UI and Scope UI, like so:

<Image src={nestedNamespaces} />

The hierarchal order formed by namespacing, allows us to select sets of components using semantic structures rather than our concrete (and prone to change) workspace directory structure.

For example, the following configuration will set the React env on all components under the `ui` namespace, regardless or their physical location inside the workspace:

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ui/**}": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## View component IDs

### List all component IDs in the local scope

(i.e, versioned components in the workspace)

```bash
bit list
```

### View the component ID of a specific component

```bash
bit show <component-full-name>
```

## Change a component ID

A component's ID cannot be changed. Instead, deprecate <!--TODO [deprecate](#) --> the current component and create a new one.

It is advisable to exchange links (between the old and the new component) in the components' documentation.
