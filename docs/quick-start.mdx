Bit helps developers compose and collaborate on modern applications with [independent components](/components/overview) and dependencies.
It makes development of component-driven and modular systems fast, standard, consistent and scalable.

## Installing Bit

Install Bit using [BVM](/), Bit's version manager.

<Tabs
defaultValue="NPM"
values={[
{label: 'NPM', value: 'NPM'},
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'Yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="NPM">

```bash
npm i -g @teambit/bvm
bvm install
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @teambit/bvm
bvm install
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Compose Components

Bit is all about creating [Independent Components](/components/overview) and composing them together. You can think if it
as building components in a Monorepo where every component gets the benefits of being an independent repo with the simplicity of developing a regular app.

### Creating a Workspace

A [Workspace](workspace/overview) is where you build components and compose them into applications. Creating a [Workspace](/workspace/overview) can be done with a single command through 
Workspace Templates. For more Workspace Templates search [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/templates). 

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
cd my-workspace
bit start
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
mkdir my-workspace && cd my-workspace
bit init
```

To use the Angular environment, you first need to check what is the latest version available:

```bash
npm dist-tag ls @teambit/angular-v12
```

Then add the following lines in your workspace.jsonc file to apply the Angular development environment on all components in this workspace (replace x.x.x by the latest version available):

```bash
{
...
  // replace x.x.x by the latest version available
  "teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": {},
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
      // replace x.x.x by the latest version available
      "teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": { }
    }
  },
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": [
      // Replace `v12` by the version of Angular that you want to use
      "teambit.angular/angular-v12"
    ]
  }
}
```

```bash
bit install
bit start
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create Components

[Creating Components](/) can be doing using our pre-defined templates which generates all necessary files for your component including compositions, docs and test files.
Components must be in their own directory and have an index file that exports the component.

The following command will add a new component to your workspace under the [namespace](/) of 'ui'.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
bit create ng-lib ui/my-component
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Use the `bit templates` command to see a list of available templates.
:::

Learn more about [Creating Components](/) including how to [create your own templates](/).

### Common Component Operations

Bit helps to simplify and standardize common operations required for developing components like [compiling](/), [testing](/), [linting](/), [formatting](/) and more.
To learn more about the different services available in Bit go to Env Services.

```bash
bit compile # compile your components and output in the `node_modules` directory
bit test # test your components
bit lint # lint your components
bit format # format your components
```

You can use the `--help` flag for each of these commands to learn more.

:::note
Bit automatically watches and re-executes your component's tests when using `bit start`.
:::

Learn more about [component testing](/).

## Release Components

Version your components and host them remotely to collaborate with others.

### Version Components

With Bit status, you can see which components have changes and need to be versioned as well as how dependents are affected
from these changes.

```bash
bit status
```

Bit helps version multiple components and dependencies at ease. Version changed components and their dependents
with a single command.

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0 --message 'my first version'
```

### Export Components

To export your components you need to create a remote scope. Creating a remote Scope can be done
by hosting your own or creating a Scope on [Bit's cloud provider](https://bit.dev),

```bash
bit export
```

:::note
Before exporting make sure you have set the default scope to be your [remote scope](/) in the `workspace.jsonc` file.
:::

## Use and Collaborate on Components

### Install Components

Bit helps you install and resolve packages in your workspace with the Bit install command. It makes sure that every
component in your Workspace is resolved with the right package dependencies and their corresponding versions.

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the `workspace.jsonc` file. Supported package managers
for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

Components can be installed with any package manager in any other app, whether it is a Bit Workspace or not.

- NPM: `npm install @some-org.scope/my-component`
- Yarn: `yarn add @some-org.scope/my-component`

Make sure you [configure the Bit registry](/) if you are using Bit's cloud provider. Components can be published to any registry or integrated with Artifactory or Nexus.

### Importing Components

Components can be [imported(cloned)](/) to any Bit Workspace. By importing components you can make changes to any component
from any Bit Workspace and then export a new version and eject it from your workspace.

```bash
bit import some-org.scope/my-component
```

<!-- ### Change requests

Create a new branch for your component, commit your changes and then export your components to a remote scope.

```bash
bit switch my-feature --create # create and switch to a new branch called my-feature
bit snap --all # commit all changes
bit export # export your components to a remote scope
```
