Bit helps developers compose and collaborate on modern applications with independent components and dependencies.
It makes development of component-driven and modular systems fast, standard, consistent and scalable.

## Installing Bit

Install Bit using [BVM](/), Bit's version manager.

<Tabs
defaultValue="NPM"
values={[
{label: 'NPM', value: 'NPM'},
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'Yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="NPM">

```bash
npm i -g @teambit/bvm
bvm install
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @teambit/bvm
bvm install
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Learn more about upgrading Bit to the latest version in our [upgrading guide](/guides/upgrading/).

## Compose Components

Bit is all about creating [Independent Components](/components/overview) and composing them together. You can think if it
as building components in a Monorepo where every component gets the benefits of being an independent repo with the simplicity of developing a regular app.

### Creating a Workspace

A Workspace is where you will compose and manage your components. Creating a [Workspace](/workspace/overview) can be done with a single command.

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
cd my-workspace
bit start
```

Learn more about [Workspaces](/)

### Create Components

[Creating Components](/) can be doing using our pre-defined templates which generates all necessary files for your component including compositions, docs and test files.

```bash
bit create react my-component
```

:::note
Use the `bit templates` command to see a list of available templates.
:::

Learn more about [Creating Components](/) including how to create your own templates.

### Common Component Operations

Bit helps to simplify and standardize common operations required for developing components like [compiling](/), [testing](/), [linting](/), [formatting](/) and more.
To learn more about the different services available in Bit go to [Env Services](/envs/core-services).

```bash
bit compile // compile your components and output in the `node_modules` directory.
bit test // test your components.
bit lint // lint your components.
bit format // format your components
```

You can use the `--help` flag for each of these commands to learn more.

:::note
Bit automatically watches and re-executes your component tests when using `bit start`,
:::

Learn more about [component testing](/).

## Release Components

Version your components and host them remotely to collaborate with others.

### Version Components

<!-- debbie decide here -->

With Bit status, you can see which components have changes and need to be versioned as well as how dependents are affected
from these changes.

```bash
bit status
```

Bit helps version multiple components and dependencies at ease. Version changed components and their dependents
with a single command.

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0 --message 'my first version'
```

### Export Components

To export your components you would have to create your remote scope. Creating a remote Scope can be done
by [hosting your own](/scope/host) or create a Scope on [bit.dev](#).

```bash
bit export
```

## Use and Collaborate on Components

### Install Components

Bit helps you install and resolve packages in your workspace with the Bit install command. It makes sure that every
component in your Workspace is resolved with the right package dependencies and their corresponding versions.

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the workspace.json file. Supported package managers
for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

Also, components can be installed with any package manager from any other app whether it is a Bit Workspace or not.

```bash
npm install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

Just make sure to [configure the Bit registry](/) if you are using bit.dev.
Also, components can be published to any registry or integrated with Artifactory or Nexus.

### Importing Components

Components can be imported to any Bit Workspace. By importing components you can make changes to any component
from any project or Bit Workspace.

```bash
bit import teambit.base-ui/my-component
```

### Change requests

```bash
bit switch my-feature --create
bit snap --all
bit export
```
