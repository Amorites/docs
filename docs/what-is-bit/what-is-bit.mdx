# Bit

Bit is an extensible, open-source toolchain for composing component-driven systems from independent components. It helps developers 
compose and collaborate on modern applications with independent components and dependencies and makes development of 
component-driven simple, fast, standard, consistent and scalable.

In Bit we build components first, then apps. We build every component independently as its own module and the app is just another component composed from all these components. 
Instead of building a monolithic application that consists lots of "internal" components, which has no additional value,
we build independent components that compose to build many different applications. This is another way of thinking. The application is just a deployment therefore it has no meaning. It's just a composition of everything that is deployed to somewhere. Building with Bit helps you build more modular, maintainable, testable, and reusable code.

## Rapid app development
Use components to accelerate your app development. Reuse and iterate on existing components to ship faster
while increasing your component economy. 

## Consistency
Reusing components allows consistency. Make sure apps are consistent in behavior and design by using the same components
and solving every problem just once. 

## Cross team collaboration
Use Bit to scale cross team collaboration, use other team components and share your own. Collaborate through dependencies
and dependents.

## Standardization
Turn your development environment into a reusable component and standardize best practices for compilation, linting, testing and more.


Main features:

## Workspace
Component development workspace designed for development of distributed systems with a monolithic and seamless dev experience.
With the Bit workspace you get the experience for building a React app using Next.JS or CRA while developing an application
from independent components. It is a monorepo without the overhead of managing one..

## Component
Stateful micro-repository for an independent component. Designed for versioning, composition and isolation of components. 
Composable system for automation, visualization and control of dependencies for independent components.

## Envs
Composable engine for creating, reusing and standardizing component development environments.
It is like a generic react-scripts.

## Scope
The component server designed for team ownership, autonomy and cross-team collaboration.

## Extend
Bit is extensible from the ground up...
