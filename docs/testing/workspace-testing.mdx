During development, Bit tests your components using the `bit test` and `bit watch` commands. These commands
provide a standard dev experience for testing any kind of [Component](#), whether it is a NodeJS modules,
a React component or anything else.

## Test all components in the Workspace

Bit tests all components in the [Workspace](/) regardless to the configured [Env](/) and therefor tester,
with a single command.

```bash
bit test
```

## Watch for changes and retest

Watching for component changes and retesting can be done with a single command.

```bash
bit watch
```

Watch starts by default when starting the [Workspace](/) UI.

```bash
bit start
```

## CLI References

- [bit test](/)
- [bit watch](/)
- [bit start](/)

## Tester workspace configurations

The Tester can be configured in the `workspace.jsonc` configuration file.

### watchOnStart

Determines whether to run the Tester in 'watch mode' when the running the development server.

For example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://static.bit.dev/teambit/schemas/schema.json",
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace-name",
    "icon": "https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg",
    "defaultScope": "my-org.my-scope"
  },
  "teambit.defender/tester": {
    "watchOnStart": false
  }
}
```

### patterns

Determines the file extensions for test files.

For example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://static.bit.dev/teambit/schemas/schema.json",
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace-name",
    "icon": "https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg",
    "defaultScope": "my-org.my-scope"
  },
  "teambit.defender/tester": {
    "patterns": ["*.spec.ts", "*.another-extension.ts"]
  }
}
```
