title: Build Tasks

The PKG aspect responsible for packing and publishing the component package, adds its own build tasks to the build pipelines.

* __Build pipeline__: prepares the package and executes ['dry run'](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-publish#dry-run)

* __Snap pipeline__: packs the package.

* __Tag pipeline__: packs and publishes the package.
