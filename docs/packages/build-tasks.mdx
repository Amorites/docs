title: Build Tasks
---

The PKG aspect responsible for packing and publishing the component package, adds its own build tasks to the build pipelines.

- **Build pipeline**: prepares the package and executes ['dry run'](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-publish#dry-run)

- **Snap pipeline**: packs the package.

- **Tag pipeline**: packs and publishes the package.
