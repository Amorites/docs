Bit's [Pkg](packages/overview) Aspect is automating the management of the [package.json](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json/) file.

A package file is generated by the [Pkg](packages/overview) aspect in Component Capsules <!-- TODO [Component Capsules](builder/capsule) --> and [Workspace Component Links](/workspace/workspace-component-link) and included in the [package generated](/packages/packing-components) for each [Component](/components/overview).

Example generated package.json

```json
{
  "name": "@my-org/people.ui.avatar",
  "version": "1.0.4",
  "homepage": "https://bit.dev/my-org/people/ui/avatar",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "componentId": {
    "scope": "my-org.people",
    "name": "ui/avatar",
    "version": "1.0.4"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "...": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "...": "12.20.4"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "...": "12.0.0"
  },
  "license": "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE"
}

## Main file

`mainFile` property in the [package.json](/packages/package-json) is automated from the Component defined [Main File](/components/main-file).

To learn more on how to set and control [Component Main File here](/components/main-file).

## Dependencies

All dependency related properties are automated and handled by Bit the [Dependency Resolver](/dependencies/overview) Aspect.

Component dependencies are detected and resolved from the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory.

### Tracking a Component with a main file

```bash
bit add path/to/button --main button.ts
```

## The `componentId` property

The `componentId` property is used by Bit to associate packages in the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directories to Bit [Components](/components/overview). Packages that does not include this property would be considered by Bit as a generic package and won't be recognized as a Bit Component.
