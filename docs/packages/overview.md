External dependencies in JS projects are consumed and managed as packages.
Independent components are no exception.  

Part of an independent component's release process includes generating a package and publishing it to a package registry.
The `package.json` file is auto-generated by Bit, or more specifically by the [PKG aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/pkg/pkg). It includes the component's dependency tree and other properties that were determined by the workspace and the various Aspects used by that component.

A component's package properties (listed int the `package.json`), as well as the package registry, are all customizable using the [PKG aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/pkg/pkg) (by default, component packages are published to [Bit Cloud](https://bit.dev)).
