A [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is where you will compose and manage your components. Creating a Workspace can be done with a single command. A workspace can be created in an empty directory or in an existing project.

To see a list of available workspaces templates, run `bit templates`. The workspace templates are only available when ran outside of a bit workspace.

```bash
bit templates
```

## Creating a Workspace

The `bit new` command will create a new workspace, configured to use a specific environment, with the name `my-workspace`. The `bit init` command will create a workspace in which you must configure the environment.

> The `bit start` command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
cd my-workspace
bit start
```

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
mkdir my-workspace && cd my-workspace
bit init
```

To use the Angular environment, you first need to check what is the latest version available:

```bash
npm dist-tag ls @teambit/angular-v12
```

Then add the following lines in your workspace.jsonc file to apply the Angular development environment on all components in this workspace (replace x.x.x by the latest version available):

```bash
"teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": {},
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "*": {
    // Replace `v12` by the version of Angular that you want to use
    "teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": { }
  }
},
"teambit.generator/generator": {
  "aspects": [
    // Replace `v12` by the version of Angular that you want to use
    "teambit.angular/angular-v12"
  ]
}
```

```bash
bit install
bit start
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you create a new workspace the following files and folders are created:

- **[workspace.jsonc](/)** - The workspace configuration file.
- **[.bitmap](/)** - An auto generated file that maps your components from your local directory.
- **.gitignore** - A git ignore file that tells git which files to ignore.
- **README.md** - A readme file that describes your workspace.
- **pnpm-lock.yaml** - A lock file that tells pnpm to install packages in the workspace.
- **types** - A directory that contains the type definitions for your components.
- **demo** - A folder that contains demo components if using bit new.
- **node_modules** - A directory that contains all modules needed for Bit to work.

### Setting the Default Scope

The default scope is the collection, or remote scope, that you want your components to be exported to. By default all components will be exported to this scope. The default scope is made up of the 'owner' of the collection, for example a username or organization, followed by the name of the collection and is separated by a dot.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react my-workspace --default-scope my-org.my-scope
```

Or configure it manually

```jsonc title=worksapce.jsonc
"defaultScope": "my-org.my-scope"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

This can be configured manually in the `workspace.jsonc` file.

```jsonc title=worksapce.jsonc
"defaultScope": "my-org.my-scope"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning
When components are created they use the default scope as part of the component id. If you modify the default scope after creating components and consuming them, you will need to update any import statements of these components. Then run `bit link` and `bit compile`and the components will work as expected.
:::

:::info Exporting to Different Scopes
You can also set components to be exported to different scopes by configuring them under the [variants](/) in the `workspace.jsonc` file. This means you can have one workspace that exports to multiple remote scopes.

### Creating an Empty Workspace

An empty workspace is a workspace configured with the correct environment but with no components. This can be created using the `--empty` flag.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react my-workspace --empty
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

feature not available yet for Angular

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Creating a Workspace without git

This will create a workspace without git. This is useful when you want to create a workspace in an existing project.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react my-workspace --standalone
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

Feature not available yet in Angular.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Workspace for a Component Library

The `bit new *-lib` command will create a new workspace with the name `my-lib` that includes demo components for building a Component Library.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react-lib my-lib
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

Feature not available yet in Angular.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Workspace for an App

The `bit new *-app` command will create a new workspace with the name `my-app` that includes demo components for building an application.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react-app my-app
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

Feature not available yet in Angular.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initializing a Workspace

Use the `bit init` command to an initialize a workspace with no configuration

```bash
bit init
```

### Resetting a Workspace

To reset a workspace to its initial state, use the `bit reset` command.

```bash
bit init --reset
```

Delete all Bit files and directories, including Bit configuration, tracking and model data. Useful when you need to re-start and use Bit from scratch.

```bash
bit --init reset-hard
```

## Generating a Custom Workspace

You can generate your own [workspace template](/workspace/templates) and customize it to your needs.

```bash
bit create workspace-generator my-workspace
```
