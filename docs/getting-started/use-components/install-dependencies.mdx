title: Install Dependencies

We depend on each other's code and components so we don't have to re-implement code. With Bit we can install components as dependencies. To install a dependency in your workspace, use the `bit install` command:

```sh
bit install @my-org.scope/my-component
```

Bit installs `@my-org.scope/my-component` as a dependency to your workspace and automatically adds it to the dependency policy in your `workspace.jsonc` file:

```js {6} title="workspace.jsonc"
...
"teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm",
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "@my-org.scope/my-component": "1.0.0"
      }
    }
}
...
```

`@my-org.scope/my-component` is installed in the workspace but is not added as a dependency to any component.

### Adding a Dependency to a Component

Bit automates dependency management by finding all `import` statements in your code and resolving them to the installed dependency in your workspace. To add the component as a dependency:

```js title="my-component.tsx"
import { MyComponent } from '@my-org.scope/my-component';
```

## Viewing Component Dependencies

To view component dependencies run the `bit show` command followed by the component id:

```sh
bit show <component-id>
```
