## Import Components

A fundamental feature of a Bit workspace is the ability to vendor components. This means you can use a single command, and instead of adding a component as a dependency, you import that component's implementation to your workspace, as-if you are its author.

```sh
bit import my-org.my-scope/my-teams-component
```

> Components you `import` will be visible on the local dev server.

You can do local modifications to it, commit to your Git repository and work with it as if it is yours, even to the point of exporting a new version for that component.

### Eject components

You can remove a component from the codebase and turn it to a dependency with the `eject` command:

```sh
bit eject my-teams-component
```

Bit then removes the component code from your code base and adds that component as a dependency to your `workspace.json`.
