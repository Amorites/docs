## Document your Components

Documenting your components is done by creating a `.docs` file. By creating good documentation you can help other developers understand your components and how they work. We use [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) to generate documentation from your code however sometimes this isn't enough which is why we have a `.docs` file. Written explanations as well as Codeblocks and live playgrounds can be added to enhance the documentation.

```js
<Text text="hello from Text" />
```

```js live
<Text text="hello from Text" />
```

## Visualize your Components

To visualize components we use the `.compositions` file. Compositions allow us to create our components in different states. This also means we can test our components in different states. To visualize your components with a part

## Test your Components

Component testing is done through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with the default `teambit.react/react` environment.

To test your components run the following command:

```bash
bit test
```

To run your components in watch mode run the following command:

```bash
bit test --watch
```

## Lint your Components

Bit uses ESLint to lint your components.

To use ESLint run the following command:

```bash
bit lint
bit lint --fix
```

## Format your Components

Bit uses Prettier to format your components.

To use Prettier run the following command:

```bash
bit format --check
bit format
```

## Compile your Components

Compile happens in your workspace and creates the dist folder for the component. You can use the `compile` command to ensure your components are working correctly. By default, component compilation is done with the TypeScript compiler. The target format is `ES2015` which supports execution from both NodeJS and browser runtimes for server-side rendering. The TypeScript compiler will compile both TypeScript and JavaScript components.

To compile your components run the following command:

```bash
bit compile
```

## Build your Components

Bit builds your components in 'capsules' meaning they are 100% isolated. This is needed for when running CI as Bit runs the complete build pipeline when running this command.

You can build your components with the following command:

```bash
bit build
```
