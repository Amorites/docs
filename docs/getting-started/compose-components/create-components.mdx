## What is a Bit Component?

A Bit component is a reusable piece of code such as a react or angular component, a shared stylesheet (eg CSS, SASS, LESS) or a utility function. Bit makes your component completely independent. This means your component contains everything it needs to be able to be consumed in any other application of the same environment.

Bit allows you to version your component similar to how you version a package in npm and once versioned it includes everything it needs to be independent as it becomes it's own module complete with package.json, dependencies and configurations. This is all done for you in the versioning process so that you don't have to maintain these for each component. Making your components independent helps with scaling as you can easily share them with other developers and reuse them in other projects.

## Create your first components

To see a list of available component templates run the `bit templates` command.

```bash
bit templates
```

Creating components can be done with a single command using the component generator.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit create react my-component     # TypeScript
bit create react-js my-component  # JavaScript
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
bit create ng-lib my-component
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you create a component the following files are created inside your component folder. All Bit components must be contained within a folder and have an index file as the main entry point.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
└── ui/my-component # Entry point for the component.
    ├── index.tsx # Main component file.
    ├── my-component.tsx # Test file for the component.
    ├── my-component.composition.tsx # RComposition file so you can render your component and visualize it in different contexts.
    └── my-component.docs.mdx # Documentation file for the component.
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
└── my-component
    ├── public-api.ts # Entry point for the component.
    └── src
        ├── my-component.component.ts # Main component file.
        ├── my-component.module.ts # Module file.
        ├── my-component.spec.ts # Test file for the component.
        ├── my-component.docs.md # Documentation file for the component.
        └── compositions
            └── my-component.composition.ts # Composition file so you can render your component and visualize it in different contexts.
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can choose to not include tests files, docs files or even the composition files, however we highly recommend in including all of these as it encourages best practices and makes it easier for other developers to understand and trust your component.

:::tip TypeScript Native
Bit is TypeScript first meaning we not just fully support but recommend using TypeScript for various reasons such as:

- type checking at compile time instead of at run time when just using JavaScript.
- better development experience due to autocomplete in your code editor.
- large code bases are easier to maintain when using Typescript because you have better control on how your code can be used.

However you can still use JavaScript should you prefer and can even have a mix of both TypeScript and JavaScript in your workspace.
:::

### Component Generator

You can create your own [component generator](/) with custom templates to suit your needs.

```bash
bit create component-generator my-templates
```

### Adding Styles to your Component

We have not included any styles in our component templates. This is simply because there are many ways to add styling to your project. You can of course use CSS, any SASS, Less and other CSS-preprocessors and CSS-in-JS frameworks.

If you want to add styles to your component you can do so by adding a `my-component.styles.scss` file to your component folder and importing it in the component file.

```ts
import styles from './my-component.module.scss';
```

You can also create your own component templates with your preferred styling using our [component generator](/).

### Component Environments

When creating a component it is important to make sure you are using the correct environment. React components should use the React environment, Angular components should use the Angular environment, Node components should use the Node environment and so on. You can check the components environment by running the `bit env` command.

```bash
bit env
```

We configure the environment in the `workspace.jsonc` file under the [variants](/) section.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ui/**}": {
      "teambit.harmony/react": {}
    }
  }
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
"teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": {}, // Registers the Angular Aspect
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "{ui/**}": {
    // Replace `v12` by the version of Angular that you want to use
    "teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": {}
  }
},
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Multiple Environments

You can have more than one environment in your workspace meaning you can have React and Angular components in the same workspace. When setting up the variants make sure you add a namespace to distinguish between them such as react-ui and angular-ui.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
"teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": {}, // Registers the Angular Aspect
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{react-ui/**}": {
      "teambit.harmony/react": {}
    },
    "{angular-ui/**}": {
      // Replace `v12` by the version of Angular that you want to use
      "teambit.angular/angular-v12@x.x.x": {}
    }
  }
```

:::tip Custom Environments
You can also create your own [custom environments](/) for your components by extending the available environments. This allows you to override configs, apply themes to all your compositions and more.
:::

### Component Namespaces

Namespaces are a way of grouping your components together. When creating ui components, for example, we might want to create them under the namespace of 'ui'. This makes it easier to find all 'ui' components as well as apply specific environments to a set of components. You can have more than one level of namespaces such as 'ui/styles', this namespace will then become part of the components id which is used when installing and consuming the component.

Namespaces do not have to be the same as the directory structure of your project however we encourage you to use the same structure for ease of use.

You can add namespaces to your components when creating them by adding the namespace followed by a slash before your component name or by using the `--namespace` flag.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component
bit create react my-component --namespace ui
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
bit create ng-lib ui/my-component
bit create ng-lib my-component --namespace ui
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Component Path

Components are created in the default directory set in the `workspace.jsonc`file. If you want to set a different directory structure for your components you can specify it when creating them by using the `--path` flag. This flag supports nesting of directories separated by slashes.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component --path react/base-ui
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
bit create ng-lib ui/my-component --path angular/base-ui
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The path can also be set in the `workspace.jsonc` file.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
"defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}",
```

### Component Scope

Components are created in the default directory set in your `workspace.jsonc` file. If you want components to be created under a different directory you can use the `--scope` flag. Scopes are set using an org name followed by a dot and then the scope name, `my-org.scope`. If you want to have a nested directory structure you can use teh `--path` flag instead.

<Tabs
groupId="frameworks"
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component --scope my-org.different-scope
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
bit create ng-lib ui/my-component --scope my-org.different-scope
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Removing Components

When we create components they are added to the `.bitmap` file. This file maps your component from the directory structure to it's namespace. The `.bitmap` file is an auto generated file that is generated every time you create a new component therefore you should not edit this file directly..In order to remove a component you can use the `bit remove` command followed by the components ID. The component ID is made up of its namespace followed by the component name.

```bash
bit remove ui/my-component
```

:::tip Delete Component Files
To delete the component's files as well as delete them from the bitmap use the `--delete-files` flag.
:::

## Adding Components

You can add components to Bit using the `bit add` command. This command will track the component by adding it to your `.bitmap` file. Use `bit add` followed by the components path/directory structure.

```bash
bit add my-scope/ui/my-component
```

Use the `--namespace` flag to specify the namespace of the component.

```bash
bit add my-scope/ui/my-component --namespace ui
```

## Moving Components

To move a component you can use the `bit move` command. This command will move the component from the current directory to the new directory.

```bash
bit move ui/my-component design/my-component
```

:::tip Move v Remove Components
This will only affect how your components are ordered in your workspace and not in your `.bitmap` file. If you want to move a component to a different namespace you will need to first remove it and then add it again with the correct namespace.
