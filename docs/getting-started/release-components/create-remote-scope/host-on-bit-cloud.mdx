By default, Bit is connected to [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) as its default hosting provider. Run the bit login command for Bit to open a login/sign-up form for a new personal account.

```bash
bit login
```

Once logged in you can create a remote scope for your Bit project. This is done on the [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) website. Start by choosing if it is a team project or personal project. Then give your remote scope a name and select if you want your scope to be public or private.

## Updating the Default Scope

Once you have setup a remote scope you need to make sure the defaultScope is set to the name of your remote scope in the `workspace.jsonc` file.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultScope": "your-username.your-scope"
  }
}
```

## Updating the Scope for a set of Components

With Bit you can export different sets of components to different scopes. This is done by adding a `defaultScope` property in the variants section of your `workspace.jsonc` file.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ecommerce/**}": {
      "defaultScope": "my-org.ecommerce"
    },
    "{ui/**}": {
      "defaultScope": "my-org.base-ui"
    },
  }
```

## Updating your Components

If you have created components with a different scope name and want to update them to the new scope you can do so by running the `bit rewire` command. When importing a component, even locally, the scope is used as part of the import path.

```bash
bit rewire
```
