## Overview

Learn how to host your components on the Bit Cloud, how to set your default scope or how to set multiple default scopes so you can publish your components from one workspace to multiple remote scopes.

## Login to the Bit Cloud

By default, Bit is connected to [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) as its default hosting provider. Run the bit login command for Bit to open a login/sign-up form for a new personal account.

```bash
bit login
```

Once logged in you can create a remote scope for your Bit project. This is done on the [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) website. Start by choosing if it is a team project or personal project. Then give your remote scope a name and select if you want your scope to be public or private.

## Setting the Default Scope

Once you have setup a remote scope you need to make sure the defaultScope is set to the name of your remote scope in the `workspace.jsonc` file.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultScope": "your-username.your-scope"
  }
}
```

## Setting Multiple Default Scopes

With Bit you can export different sets of components to different scopes. This is done by adding a `defaultScope` property to each set of components in the variants section of your `workspace.jsonc` file.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ecommerce/**}": {
      "defaultScope": "my-org.ecommerce"
    },
    "{ui/**}": {
      "defaultScope": "my-org.base-ui"
    },
  }
```

### Publish your Components

In order to publish components to the Bit Cloud they must be tagged by using the `bit tag` command. Bit will run all tests and build a new version of each component as well as generate a `package.json` file for each one. It is during this process that your components get published to Bit Cloud.

```bash
bit tag --all --message "first version"
```

### Exporting your Components

After tagging is complete components can be exported to your remote scope on Bit.dev using the `bit export` command.

```bash
bit export
```
