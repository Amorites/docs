Components can be versioned, built and exported from any standard CI. 

### Install and configure Bit

Follow the instructions in [bit docker readme](https://github.com/teambit/bit/blob/master/scripts/docker-teambit-bit) to get a docker with bit installed.

To configure bit on the server, you need to run the following commands:

```shell
bit config set user.token ${BIT_TOKEN}
```

### Versioning and Publishing

The flow for versioning and publishing components work as follows:

1. On your local computer run `bit tag` with the `--soft` option to annotate that modified components should be versioned and exported.
1. Bit updates `.bitmap` with information on new versions to publish.
1. Collaborate with your peers on the soon-to-be published components, their semantic version and changelog messages.
1. Merge changes to main branch.
1. CI/CD versions all marked components and publish them.
1. CI/CD commits back to the repository the updated `.bitmap` without annotations on versions to be exported.

> **Where is the 'test' and 'build'?**
>
> The `tag` command runs the 'build pipeline' before versioning a component. This pipeline includes building and testing. if any of these tasks fails, the versioning process will be aborted.

:::info use soft tags in local workspaces
Components in local workspaces should be 'soft-tagged'.
That means they are registered in the `.bitmap` file as pending to be versioned, but not yet versioned.
The versioning process should only happen in the CI (once changes to the workspace are pushed to the remote repository).
This enables collaboration on components before they are tagged and exported.
