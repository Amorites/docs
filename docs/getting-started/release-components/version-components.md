Bit helps with version control for independent components and dependencies with the goal to make component reuse consistent and immutable. Every component is versioned independently along side with its dependencies. Upon versioning, Bit persists the current state of component source code and resolves the required set of dependencies and their used version.

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0
```

You can also use [Snap](/components/snaps).
