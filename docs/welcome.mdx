Bit is an extensible, [open-source toolchain](https://github.com/teambit/bit) for building independent components, and composing them into high-performance and consistent modular and <!-- TODO[component-driven apps](/component-driven-apps) --> component-driven apps at speed.

It makes it easy to develop modular software projects from independently versioned components, connected through a dependency graph and which can be owned by numerous autonomous teams, collaborating together to deliver modern apps at speed, consistency and scale. It is a simple, modular and efficient way to build a single web application, while allowing to scale to any amount on teams collaborating together.

Bit is designed to enable a component-first approach, where [Components](/components/overview) are built independently and composed into <!-- TODO [Apps](/apps/overview) --> apps. This approach highly increases the value of each [Component](/components/overview) by making it a decoupled, collaborative, discoverable and composable unit of source code, promoting <!-- TODO [rapid app development](/) --> rapid app development, <!-- TODO [consistency](/) --> consistency and <!-- TODO [cross team collaboration](/) --> cross team collaboration.

In Bit, each [Component](/components/overview) is independent and acts as a standalone versioned unit of source code, connected through [Dependencies](/dependencies/overview) to others. Each component can be independently developed, built and shipped to [Scopes](/scope/overview) to ensure cross-team collaboration, consistency, resilience and performance at any scale.

While Bit is tech-agnostic, development environments for specific tech are automated through [Envs](/envs/overview) to provide a customizable, repeatable and standard dev experience for development of [Components](/components/overview).

Officially supported [Envs](/envs/overview) exist for [Node](/envs/pre-configured-envs/nodejs), [React](/envs/pre-configured-envs/react), [Angular](/envs/pre-configured-envs/angular) and [more](/envs/overview). An [Env](/envs/overview) can be composed of all the great tools the community offers like [TypeScript](/apsects/typescript), [Babel](/aspects/babel), <!-- TODO [Jest](/aspects/jest) -->, Jest <!-- TODO [ESLint](/eslint/overview) --> ESLint, <!-- TODO [Webpack](/webpack/overview) --> webpack and dozens of others. Bit was designed to be fully compatible with community standards and therefore can easily be used with any standard tool throughout the JS ecosystem.

You can build and extend Bit just like us. Bit is a composition of [Aspects](extending-bit/overview). It comes built in with a set of configured Aspects and can be extended by configuring new Aspects to it. Every [Aspect](/extending-bit/overview) is a feature in Bit. Main core features are: [Workspace](/workspace/overview), [Component](/components/overview), [Envs](/envs/overview) and [Scope](/scope/overview). Moreover, Bit is composed from over [60 core Aspects](/aspects/aspects-overview) available as APIs and variety of interfaces including [CLI](/reference/cli-reference), GraphQL APIs and UIs.

## Get started

### Install Bit

Bit can be installed with [BVM](/reference/bvm), the Bit version manager.

<Tabs
defaultValue="NPM"
values={[
{label: 'NPM', value: 'NPM'},
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'Yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="NPM">

```bash
npm i -g @teambit/bvm
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @teambit/bvm
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```bash
bvm install
```

### Why build with components?

- Better software design. SOLID and DRY.
- Simple and fast development experience.
- Blazing fast component builds. Build only affected components.
- Large scale collaboration through API usage, discovery and source-code visibility and accessability.
- Achieve cross-organization consistency and predictability.
- Autonomy.

### Create your first component development Workspace

[Workspaces](/workspace/overview) can be easily generated from <!-- TODO [Workspace Templates](/workspace/workspace-templates)  --> Workspace Templates or <!-- TODO [initiated on existing repositories](start-from-existing) --> initiated on existing repositories. For more Workspace Templates use the `bit templates` command or search [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/templates).

<Tabs
defaultValue="React"
values={[
{label: 'React', value: 'React'},
{/* TODO {label: 'Angular', value: 'Angular'},
{label: 'Node', value: 'Node'}, */}
]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```bash
bit new react my-first-workspace
```

  </TabItem>
  {/* TODO <TabItem value="Angular">

```bash
bit new angular my-first-workspace
```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Node">

```bash
bit new node my-first-workspace
```

  </TabItem> */}
</Tabs>

## TypeScript Native

Bit was designed to be [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) native as Type Systems are helpful in decoupling and collaborating on source code at scale. Our official [Envs](/envs/overview) ship with the TypeScript compiler by default which also supports JS compilation but can be customized to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io).

- Doc generation is more accurate.
- Better completions and type checking is provided in IDE.
- Type checking helps catch error quickly and fail fast.

## Common use cases for Bit

Building from [Components](/components/overview) helps and solves numerous common pains and use cases. Either technical or structural issues where tech limits architecture.

- [Micro Frontends](/understanding-bit/micro-architecture/micro-architecture)
- Design system component libraries.<!--TODO [Design system component libraries](component-lib/overview) -->
- [Monorepos](/understanding-bit/repository-architecture/bit-monorepo).
- Modular server side development <!-- TODO [Modular server side development](server-side/overview) -->.

## Host Components on [bit.dev](https://bit.dev)

While Bit is a 100% open source platform where you can create your own Bit-server, [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is a cloud service provided by Bit where you can quickly set an account to publish your components. [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is free for open source components and projects.
