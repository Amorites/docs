Bit is an extensible, [open-source toolchain](https://github.com/teambit/bit) for building independent components, and composing them into high-performance and consistent component-driven systems at speed. 

It helps to standardize, scale and distribute software projects into independently versioned components, connected through a dependency graph and possibly owned by autonomous teams, collaborating together to deliver modern apps at speed, consistency and scale.

Bit is designed to enable a component-first approach, where components are built independently and composed into apps. This approach increases the value of each [Component](/components/overview) by making it a decoupled, collaborative, discoverable and composable unit of source code, promoting [rapid app development](/), [consistency](/) and [cross team collaboration](/).

In Bit, each [Component](/components/overview) is independent and acts as a standalone versioned unit of source code, connected through dependencies to others. Each component can be independently developed, built, and shipped to ensure scalable collaboration, consistency, resilience.

### Philosophy

### Standardization

### 


### Monorepos
Bit works great for [Monorepos](/). Allowing to scale 


Ownership

Efficient and parallelized builds



### What is a component driven system?

- React app
- Component Library
- Angular app
- Angular Library
- Vue app

### What is Independent component.

## Thinking in components

In Bit we first build independent components, then compose them into apps. We build every component independently as its own module and the app is just another component composed from different components.
Instead of building a monolithic application that consists lots of "internal" components, which has no additional value,
we build independent components that could compose to build many different applications. This is different way of thinking, thinking in components. Building with Bit helps you build more modular, maintainable, testable, and reusable code.

### Rapid app development

### Consistency

### Cross team collaboration

### Team and developer autonomy

### Write component (code) once. Use anywhere. Really.

### Standardizing developer experiences

## Common use cases for Bit

- Micro Frontends.
- Design system component libraries.
- Distributed Monorepo.
- Modular server side development.

Bit makes the process of building modular applications and the development, publishing and management of independent components really easy. It focuses on the publishing of components whereas the consumption of components is handled by package managers such as npm or yarn.

### Bit v15 - Harmony

**Harmony** introduces major improvements to Bit and how developers should build their components. At the moment it supports **React**, **React Native** and **NodeJS**. For teams using **Angular** or **Vue**, it is recommended to get started with Bit's v14 release [here](https://docs.bit.dev).

#### Public Beta

Bit v15 **Harmony** is used by many teams and is the underlying infrastructure for Bit and [bit.dev](https://bit.dev). We decided to tag it as an **open beta** as there are still major features coming. If you are building any React/React-native and NodeJS based systems, we urge you to get started with v15.

## Additional Resources and Support

- [Chat on Slack :beers:](https://join.slack.com/t/bit-dev-community/shared_invite/zt-o2tim18y-UzwOCFdTafmFKEqm2tXE4w)
- [Start a discussion or suggest a feature or a fix on GitHub :wrench:](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues)
- Find more [resources](resources/conference-talks) and learn about Bit some more.

## Host Components on [bit.dev](https://bit.dev)

While Bit is a 100% open source platform where you can create your own Bit-server, [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is a cloud service provided by Bit where you can quickly set an account to publish your components. [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is free for open source components and projects.
